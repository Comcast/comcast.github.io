Leveraging advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP), it detects sensitive information like API keys and passwords across GitHub environments daily. Unlike existing solutions, xGitGuard utilizes AI to streamline detection, thus saving time and reducing errors. Its intelligent workflow efficiently scans code repositories, filters out irrelevant results, and sends the findings to a portal where product teams can view and remediate"

The input to xCOMPASS is answers to a list of questions about the design of the application, how it is meant to be used, and what kind of data it processes. The output is a list of privacy design strategies along with associated Global Privacy Tool or GPT obligations. The output also includes a list of personas that can be shared with developers to make it easier to understand the impact of the privacy engineering concerns identified by xCOMPASS. xCOMPASS is meant to be used when onboarding a team or application to Privacy Development Lifecycle (PDL), especially before privacy threat models, so it can be used as reference by threat model architects and privacy leads.
