2. Make a feature branch with the name of your change.

4. Commit your code.
5. Issue a Pull Request.

## Adding a New Project

If your project already exists under the [Comcast](https://github.com/Comcast) GitHub organization, then there isn't anything that you need to do. Check our Projects page [projects list](https://comcast.github.io/projects#projects) to make sure you're listed. If your project is a Comcast project residing outside of the main organization, then you'll need to add the project to the additional projects list under `src/data/additional_projects.json`.

## Contributor License Agreement

Before Comcast merges your code into the project you must sign the [Comcast Contributor License Agreement (CLA)](https://gist.github.com/ComcastOSS/a7b8933dd8e368535378cda25c92d19a).

If you haven't previously signed a Comcast CLA, you'll automatically be asked to when you open a pull request. Alternatively, we can send you a PDF that you can sign and scan back to us. Please create a new GitHub issue to request a PDF version of the CLA.
